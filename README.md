# Multifamily Real Estate Analytics Project

This project simulates the day-to-day responsibilities of a data analyst at a real estate investment firm. It includes data generation, cleaning, exploratory analysis, visualization, and report creation using Python and Excel. This is a learning project that utilizes AI-assisted programming.

## 🔍 Project Overview

The goal is to assess portfolio performance across several KPIs, including rent trends, expenses, occupancy, leasing funnel conversions, and market benchmarking. All data was simulated using Python's `Faker` library to reflect realistic scenarios.

## 📁 Datasets

- `property_info.csv` — Simulated apartment properties across 10 U.S. states
- `rent_roll.csv` — Lease-level data including rent, concessions, and occupancy
- `expenses.csv` — Operating expenses by type and property
- `leasing_funnel.csv` — Lead source and lease conversion tracking
- `market_comparables.csv` — Market rents and vacancy rates by city

## 📊 Key Analyses

- Rent trends and occupancy rates
- Expense breakdown and Net Operating Income (NOI)
- Leasing funnel performance by source and property
- Comparison to market rent and vacancy benchmarks

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Faker (for data simulation)
- Excel (for reporting)
- Git & GitHub

## 📈 Outputs

Summary reports were exported to Excel and can be found in the `/reports` folder:

- Rent & Occupancy
- NOI by Property
- Lead Funnel
- Market Comparison

## 📌 How to Run

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `generate_data.py` to regenerate all datasets
3. Open `Multifamily_Data_Analytics_Portfolio_Project.ipynb` to follow the full analysis
